I'm Aldhi (someone call me Agung), a mathematics enthusiast who live in Sragen, Central Java, Indonesia. I'm currently working at SMA Trensains Muhammadiyah Sragen as a 10th grade math teacher since 1 July 2024. Why didn’t you pursue a Master’s degree right after graduating from university? Well, I actually wanted to continue my studies right away. But as you might know, pursuing a Master's degree can be very expensive. I needed a scholarship to cover the costs. Long story short, I applied for the LPDP scholarship program by the Indonesian Ministry of Finance in Batch 2 of 2023 and Batch 1 of early 2024. Unfortunately, I didn’t pass either of them—even though I had already made it to the interview stage. Because of that, I decided to start working first while gaining some experience. After all, eventually we’ll all enter the workforce, right? That’s when I got a job opportunity as a mathematics teacher at SMA Trensains Muhammadiyah Sragen, recommended by a colleague from Ruangguru. Although the school is relatively new, in terms of achievements, it ranks first in the list of top-performing schools curated by the National Achievement Center (Pusat Prestasi Nasional). Even though I’m still new and haven’t contributed much yet, I’m incredibly proud of the school’s accomplishments. Imagine—a school that focuses on science majors, research-based learning, and Islamic boarding school values—reaching the number one spot on the national achievement list. Truly another level. So cool!

I started to enjoy studying mathematics since junior high school. Unfortunately, I hadn’t joined any math competitions at that time. I was one of those so-called "late bloomers" when it came to entering the world of math olympiads. I only got involved in math olympiads when I was in 10th grade of high school. From that moment on, I actively looked for various math competitions, whether organized by universities or government institutions. Long story short, I achieved my first award when I was in 12th grade. Imagine that—winning only when I was already at the edge of graduation. That competition, where I won first place, was held by the Mathematics Student Association of Universitas Widya Dharma, Klaten in 2018 and was a regional-level contest for the former Surakarta Residency.

Later, after being accepted as an undergraduate student in Mathematics at Universitas Gadjah Mada in 2019 through the government-funded Bidikmisi scholarship, I actively worked as a teaching assistant and grader. One of my responsibilities was to assess and give feedback on students’ work in the "Introduction to Number Theory" course. In addition, I was also involved in research with a lecturer in the field of Number Theory, focusing on the Theory of Integer Partitions. Alhamdulillah, before officially graduating, I managed to publish my very first paper in the Journal of Mathematics UNP by Universitas Negeri Padang.

To cut a long story short, after graduating in May 2023, I worked as a freelance master teacher of mathematics at Ruangguru. Then, in June 2024, I started working at SMA Trensains Muhammadiyah Sragen as a mathematics teacher for 10th-grade students, and I’m still working there to this day. With persistence and patience, I finally achieved one of my dreams: buying an ASUS TUF GAMING A15 laptop using the savings from my own work, without asking for a single penny from my parents. Besides the laptop, I also bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 9 FE+ to support my online teaching via Zoom. Furthermore, I’m also actively tutoring mathematics both offline (sometimes at my house, sometimes at the student’s house) and online via zoom, covering school mathematics, UTBK-SNBT preparation, and math olympiads at both national and international levels.

For my future plan, I will continue my Master's studies at UGM, majoring in Mathematics. I aspire to become a Mathematics lecturer, whether at a private or public university—what matters most is gaining experience early on. My target is to become a mathematics lecturer at Universitas Gadjah Mada. If that’s not yet possible, I would still be very grateful to teach at Universitas Sebelas Maret. Therefore, I need to read as much and as diligently as possible, especially scientific articles, to support my future research during my studies. To me, mathematics is not just a subject; it’s a way of thinking. It trains the mind to be logical, critical, and precise. My mission is to help students see the beauty in math, to enjoy the process of learning, and to become confident problem solvers. Through my teaching, I hope to inspire the next generation to embrace mathematics as a powerful tool for both academic success and life, especially for my country, Indonesia.
