A partition of a positive integer n is a non-increasing sequence of finite
positive integers whose sum is n. One area studied by several researchers
in the partition of integers is the crank partition function. For every
positive integer n and a partition x of n, the crank of x is defined as the
largest summand in x when x does not include a summand of 1; or as
the difference between the number of summands greater than the number
of summands of 1 in x and the number of summands of 1 in x. The
crank partition function is denoted by M(m, j, n), which represents the
number of partitions of n with a crank congruent to m modulo j. In this
study, we discuss the proof of symmetric property of the crank partition
function, namely, M(m, j, n) = M(âˆ’m, j, n). A proof is provided using
a combinatorial interpretation through the construction of a bijective
function that maps partitions with certain conditions to partitions with
other certain conditions.
