A partition of a positive integer 𝑛 is a non-increasing sequence of
finite positive integers such that the sum is equal to 𝑛. One thing that
is studied by some researchers in integer partition is binary partition.
A binary partition of a positive integer 𝑛 is a non-increasing sequence
of finite positive integers that are powers of 2 and sum to 𝑛. The
number of binary partitions of 𝑛 is denoted by 𝑏(𝑛) and is called the
binary partition function. In this study, we provides a combinatorial
interpretation of a congruence of binary partition functions modulo 2.
The interpretation involves dividing all binary partitions of 𝑛 into two
sets with the same cardinality using a bijective function that maps
binary partitions satisfying certain conditions to binary partitions
satisfying other conditions.
